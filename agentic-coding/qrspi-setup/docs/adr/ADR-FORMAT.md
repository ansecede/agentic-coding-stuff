# ADR Format

ADRs live in `docs/adr/` and use sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc.

Create the `docs/adr/` directory lazily — only when the first ADR is needed.

## Template

```
# {Short title of the decision}

{1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.}
```

That's it. An ADR can be a single paragraph. The value is in recording *that* a decision was made and *why* — not in filling out sections.

## Optional sections

Only include these when they add genuine value. Most ADRs won't need them.

* **Session** frontmatter (`session: NNN-short-description`) — links the ADR back to the QRSPI session where the decision was made; useful for audit trails
* **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`) — useful when decisions are revisited
* **Considered Options** — only when the rejected alternatives are worth remembering
* **Consequences** — only when non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out

## Numbering

Scan `docs/adr/` for the highest existing number and increment by one.

## When to write an ADR

All three of these must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will look at the code and wonder "why on earth did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If a decision is easy to reverse, skip it. If it's not surprising, nobody will wonder why. If there was no real alternative, there's nothing to record beyond "we did the obvious thing."

### What qualifies

* Architectural shape: "We're using a monorepo." "The write model is event-sourced."
* Integration patterns between contexts: "Ordering and Billing communicate via domain events, not HTTP."
* Technology choices that carry lock-in: database, message bus, auth provider, deployment target.
* Boundary and scope decisions: what each context owns and what it doesn't.
* Deliberate deviations from the obvious path — stops the next engineer from "fixing" something that was intentional.
* Constraints not visible in the code: compliance, partner SLAs, performance budgets.
* Rejected alternatives when the rejection is non-obvious.
